	  <h4>Miss Zoë Tate</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>International Instructor</li>
			<li>Qualified Grading Examiner</li>
			<li>Qualified Referee and Umpire</li>
			<li>CRB Checked</li>
			<li>Emergency First Aid Qualified</li>
		</ul>
		
			<p>Miss Tate achieved her rank of V Dan on 4th November 2012 & IV Dan on 26th February 2006 under First Grand Master Rhee Ki Ha.</p>

			<p>She started her training in 1996 at the Dundee University Club. She very quickly became club secretary and then captain. When her Instructor was no longer in 
			a position to continue teaching at the club, the University and Association asked if she would become Instructor. By this time she had already been teaching a 
			year having started a club at Abertay University.</p>

			<p>During her coloured belt years and right up until attaining her III Degree, she never missed the opportunity to compete and indeed never walked away 
			from a competition without winning at least one gold. In 1997 she was awarded a University Full Blue and given the title of University Sportswoman of the year. </p>

	  <h4>Mr Robert Dolan</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>International Instructor</li>
			<li>Qualified Referee and Umpire</li>
			<li>A Member of the B.T.C</li>
			<li>CRB Checked</li>
		</ul>

			<p>Mr Dolan achieved his rank of V Dan on 4th November 2012 and his IV Dan on 9th March 2008 under First Grand Master Rhee Ki Ha.</p>

			<p>He started his martial arts training in Shotokan Karate back when his age was in single figures. He sought out a reputable Instructor in Taekwon-Do having 
			researched its scientific nature and found the Dundee club. He took an active role in the club and was one of the first Black belts to come out of the Dundee area and 
			he soon set about establishing extra clubs within Dundee.</p>

			<p>His competing days were mainly done whilst at Karate but the competitions he did enter he walked away with at least one gold – usually including destruction.</p> <br><br><br><br>
